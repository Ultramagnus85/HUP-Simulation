## Description  
An empirically validated golden-ratio–driven simulation that visually decodes the structural mechanics behind quantum behavior and Schrödinger’s equation. This mathematically rigorous framework offers a modern replacement for existing quantum physics models, revealing the harmonic foundations of coherence, entanglement, and measurement thresholds.
