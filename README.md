## Description  
An empirically validated golden-ratio‚Äìdriven simulation that visually decodes the structural mechanics behind quantum behavior and Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs equation. This mathematically rigorous framework offers a modern replacement for existing quantum physics models, revealing the harmonic foundations of coherence, entanglement, and measurement thresholds.
